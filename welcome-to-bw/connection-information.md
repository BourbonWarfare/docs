If this is your first time connecting, you will see an "Identity Security Level" window. Hit "Start" and wait for the process to complete. You only need to do this once.\
Once you have connected, you will not be able to join any channels. Please message or poke an admin (look for the Beer Mug icon next to their name). Tell them who you are and they will give you channel permissions.

## DLC Information

DLCs are **not** a requirement to join Bourbon Warfare.

However, _**APEX**_ and _**Contact**_ are required to **fully** participate in our sessions.\
&#xNAN;_**SOG: Prairie Fire**_ is required only for certain missions using terrain from that DLC.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A compatibility modpack is available, which non-owners of _SOG_ **must** use to be able to join our sessions. For more information, see [trouble-shooting-arma-install.md](trouble-shooting-arma-install.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

Our mission-makers may use any asset or terrain available to them in our modpack, thus:

* If a mission uses gear or vehicles from a DLC you do not own, you may see in-game ads if you use those assets.
* If the mission is on a terrain from a DLC you do not own, you will be unable to play that specific mission. You can check which terrains will be used in the [After-Action Review (AAR)](https://discord.com/channels/204621032428929025/1052300343876272169) for that session.
