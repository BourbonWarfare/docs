# Session Guidelines

Here's a quick breakdown on session info and expected session behaviour.

## **Slotting**

* Try to get onto the server 15-20 minutes before the session is scheduled to start. This will allow us to get a head count and avoid connection lockup from too many people attempting to join the server at once.
* If this is your first session, make sure you are pair up with a Drinking Buddy for the session.\
  If you join late, make sure you get paired up before you slot.
* Once we begin slotting, please try to keep all non-slotting-related chatter to the in game text chat. The quicker we get to slot, the quicker we get to play. That being said, if you're lost or confused about something, please ask.

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not use the default ArmA 3 squad names (i.e. `Alpha 1-1`).\
The squad/fireteam name we use will be on the slot name itself.
{% endhint %}

* Please remember which team you are on, which fireteam you are in, and your role in that team.\
  If you need to Join-In-Progress (JIP) or get respawned, this information is crucial to get you back where you're needed.
* If the teamspeak channel gets too chatty, please respect calls to quiet down ("BREAK BREAK" or similar). It's nothing personal, we just need to get slotting out of the way.
* For Long Co-Ops, Leadership Qual slotting will be skipped for SL and PLT buddy phase. (in interest of time, smoothing play, etc. - just save it for the other 7 sessions in a month)
  * **"Qual Call"** will be done before SLs slot in regular CO-OPS, anyone who needs their SL buddy phase should speak up in this time

### **Loading/Map Screen**

* Feel free to start chit chatting here, but try to keep the volume to a reasonable level. If an admin/mission maker needs to make an announcement (generally in the loading screen before the Co-Operative (Co-Op) mission starts), please be courteous and stop talking so they can get their message out.
* Be sure to read all the briefing tabs. They will have critical information pertaining to the mission.
  * **Please do not read your briefings out loud in the loading screen**, they may contain information that is team specific, and both teams can hear each other in this screen.
  * If you have a question about your briefing, please wait until you load into the mission and then talk to your leadership. They can contact an admin/mission-maker if they don't know.
* Take a look at the map. Try to find landmarks that you can use to visually locate your position.

## **In-Game**

* If the mission starts in darkness, please do not adjust your brightness/gamma settings. The mission maker intentionally made it dark. Adjusting your settings is cheating.
* Please do not use in-game text chat at all. It breaks immersion, and it looks messy for people who are streaming/recording footage.
* Do your best to avoid [metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming).
* Your leadership will create a plan. While this is happening, make an effort to meet/talk to anyone new in your fireteam.
* While getting briefed into the plan, please be quiet and listen. Once the briefing is done, please make sure you understand what is supposed to happen and ask questions if there is any confusion.
* If you are using vehicles, please do not take gear from the vehicle's inventory unless ordered to. The gear there is generally for resupply purposes only.
* Depending on the casualties/people in your fireteam, you may be asked to take command of an element. We know it can be tough, just do your best.
* If you are having Radio issues (unable to send or receive on the radio), you can reset your radios in the ACRE map tab. If that does not work you may need to reset your ACRE plugin in Teamspeak by going to Tools -> Options -> Addons -> ACRE2 -> Reload.
* If your team takes casualties, you may be asked to take command of an element. We know it can be difficult, but just do your best.\
  **The best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing at all!**

## **Spectator**

* If you die, you will be transferred to spectator chat.
* Please take a second to cool down after your death.\
  If you are angry about something, make a note somewhere and come back to it later. Yelling at people in spectator only creates more conflict. Remain calm, courteous, and respectful.\
  Come back to it the next day, and if it's still an issue, write something about it in the [AAR](../after-action-reviews-aars.md).
* Try to keep the volume down in spectator, there can be up to 60 people in spectator and when people start out yelling each other, it gets bad.
* We don't need a play by play. Everyone in spectator is watching, too. It's one thing to say one time "Hey! Everyone check out _AACO_, he's about to get friendly-fired!" It's a completely different thing to narrate every footstep _AACO_ is taking.
* During a coop, the Zeus(es) will likely be in spectator. Please refrain from asking them/telling them what they should do. The Zeus is generally well in control of the situation and does not need backseat drivers.
* If an admin is trying to organize respawns, please avoid any non-reslotting chatter. It will only take a few minutes.
* Please do not message anyone in game on Discord, Steam or other platforms. Not only does it distract them from the task and hand, if you say the wrong thing, it can spoil the game for them/others.

## **Joining in Progress (JIPing) / Forced Respawn System**

* If your game crashes (or you join late), you can rejoin the session.
  * Take the same role you had but on a different fire team.
  * Once you get into game rejoin your team if they're still at their base
  * If they have stepped off message an admin what fireteam you were in (hit escape, enter your message in the upper left box, and make sure you **click** the message admin button) and if contact has not started they will teleport you to your team.
  * If you get back to your team, and you find you are having ACRE issues, please restart your teamspeak.
  * If contact has already begun, please hit the respawn button in the escape menu to go to spectator.
* If you get ArmA'd (Get killed by buildings/something outside of your control) before contact has started, please message an admin your FT and your role. They should be able to force respawn you and teleport you to your team. Do not go back to the slotting screen, an admin should be able to respawn you from the spectator screen.
* If you know you're joining well after contact, but want to spectate the remainder of the game, just grab a spot on the attacking team (so you don't "pop" into existence in the middle of a fight) and JIP into the game. Once you are in the game, go to the escape menu, and hit the respawn button.
* If there's a decent number of people dead during a COOP or a few people who have been dead a long time, and we take an objective an admin may jump into spectator chat and try to get reinforcements set up. Do not go back to the slotting screen, an admin can force respawns, this avoids nasty ACRE issues.
