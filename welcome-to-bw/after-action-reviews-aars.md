# After-Action Reviews (AARs)

{% hint style="info" %}
AARs are usually posted in the Discord one to two days before session, at [`#aar`](https://discord.com/channels/204621032428929025/1052300343876272169).
{% endhint %}

## Text AARs (Discord)

After-Action Reviews (AARs) are intended to:

1. Inform players before session of which missions will be played.
2. List players who took leadership roles, to direct feedback to their leadership threads.
3. Provide a central place to **respectfully** discuss missions after session.
   * What was the plan?
   * What actually happened, from your point of view during the mission?
   * What went right?
   * What went wrong? How can we improve as a team/community?
   * Did you have fun? Did you see any good or bad moments?
   * Were there any technical issues with the mission or mods, or with your game?
   * What did you like about the scenario design? Is there anything that the mission-maker could improve upon?

## Visual AAR (OCAP)

Visual AARs will automatically be uploaded to [https://aar.bourbonwarfare.com/](https://aar.bourbonwarfare.com/)

Various controls can be used in the interface to visualize each mission, including tracers for shots fired, nametags, in-game markers, etc.
