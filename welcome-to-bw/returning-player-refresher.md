# Returning Player Refresher

If you've been out for 6 months or longer:

Hop on Discord and reach out to (or even just PM) a staff member telling us that you're coming back.\
If needed, we'll get you in an orientation or refresher chat before session to make sure your mods are loaded and working correctly, and get you back up to speed.

AND If you're a recruit:

Let us know! You might have told us before that you ran out of time to play, or just lost interest, both are fine!\
You don't have to submit another application, unless you were explicitly told to do so.
