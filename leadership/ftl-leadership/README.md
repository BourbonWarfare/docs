# FTL Leadership

Welcome to leadership! Thank you for taking the step up to take charge of your fellow players and guide them to victory. It’s likely a major step forward in both your enjoyment of the game, and your development as a player. This document will walk you through the basics of Arma and BW leadership from a fireteam level. This document is intended to give an overview of leadership fundamentals for a member just entering the Fireteam Leader (FTL), but the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are applicable to all levels of leadership.

The section here is to familiarize you with the basic command and control structure of a Bourbon Warfare (BW) company and our radio procedure. After that, we’ll go into detail about the soft leadership skills it takes to be an FTL. There are very few, if any, procedures in this document that reference unit maneuvers or unit tactics. Instead, you will learn the intangible skills that enable the successful implementation of those procedures.

While Bourbon Warfare offers several levels of leadership, the FTL is the easiest to pick-up and the most engaging to master.
