### Recovering Long Range Radio

<mark style="color:orange;">Do not risk yourself to enemy fire purely to get the Long Range radio.</mark> Wait until it's safer, or have the closest member run it to you, or have them temporarily grab the 148 to relay information.

The crucial part with acquiring the 148 is <mark style="color:orange;">regaining communication with the PLT element.</mark> To them, your team has fallen off the map and they have no idea what the situation is. They need to get back in touch with the Squad ASAP.

Because they don’t know the situation, they now have a blind-spot in the greater battlespace and cannot get you reinforcements, medical attention, or any number of supporting factors. _<mark style="color:orange;">It’s critical for both you and the PLT element to re-link the chain of command in order to survive.</mark>_

### Updating PLT on status

Once you have personally have acquired the 148, <mark style="color:orange;">identify yourself as the new leadership element and give PLT an update.</mark>&#x20;

> _“PLT, Alpha, this is RecruitLuck as acting ASL. Heavy fire from the West, enemy ontop of us, need immediate support.”_

You don’t have to use those words exactly: the goal is to clearly communicate a new SL has taken over and is now in communication.

Use this time to communicate the status of the team: how strong you are, if you need extra medics (especially if in a mass-casualty event), what contact you’re facing, etc. All of this helps to give your PLT a better picture of the battlespace and your effectiveness in it.

_In missions with reduced radios, it may be necessary to utilize runners to notify PLT of any leadership or status changes._&#x20;
