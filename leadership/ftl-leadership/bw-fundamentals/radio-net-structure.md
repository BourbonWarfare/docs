# Radio Net Structure

## The Two Primary Radio Nets

1. Squad Net (<mark style="color:orange;">SQN</mark>)
   1. &#x20;Each squad is automatically assigned a Squad Net on their <mark style="color:orange;">343 radio (Short Range).</mark>
      1. &#x20;Alpha takes SQN 1, Bravo taking SQN 2, and so on.&#x20;
      2. These are unique to each squad, and will almost always be referred to by the element name (Alpha Net, Bravo Net, etc.).
   2. This net is used to <mark style="color:orange;">communicate information between squad elements on a micro level.</mark> Over the course of a session, anyone in a squad can use the squad net.&#x20;
      1. Primarily, the FTLs will be communicating and coordinating with each other in response to SL orders and information.&#x20;
      2. Each member of the fireteam will also be passing information up, and FTLs will be coordinating their members into position as well.
2. &#x20;Platoon Net (<mark style="color:orange;">PLN</mark>)
   1. Used by PLT to <mark style="color:orange;">coordinate SL elements.</mark>&#x20;
   2. Each PLT will get their own PLN (PLN 1, PLN 2) accessible by the <mark style="color:orange;">148 radio (Long Range)</mark> automatically given to PLT and all SL elements.&#x20;
      1. The PLT element passes orders down to the SL elements, the SL elements pass those orders down to FTL elements (and vice versa— <mark style="color:orange;">this is a two way street</mark>).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_There are other nets available for special assets and larger missions — CAS, Armor, COY, etc. If the mission leader decides not to use them, they will be on PLN. Keep your PLN transmissions brief if so as the PLT net can get clogged with traffic in these scenarios._
{% endhint %}

The primary focus is that <mark style="color:orange;">an FTL has to communicate with their SL on the 343,</mark> and the <mark style="color:orange;">SL will relay information via the 148.</mark>
