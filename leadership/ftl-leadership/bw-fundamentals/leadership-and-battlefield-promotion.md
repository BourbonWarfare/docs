# Leadership and Battlefield Promotion

***

### Leadership Rotates

In BW, the only structured rank system we have <mark style="color:orange;">appears purely in game.</mark> There are no community hierarchies (outside of staff moderation), and leadership transitions fluidly between volunteers every session.

Within the overall PLT Chain of Command, PLT gives orders to the SLs, and the SLs give orders to their designated fireteams. <mark style="color:orange;">All FTLs are equal in rank.</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
_At the start of any session and without qualification, you can slot as an FTL as soon as you see the Squad Leader (SL) position has been slotted._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If the SL is incapacitated, <mark style="color:orange;">one of the FTLs, typically FTL 1</mark> (i.e. Alpha 1, Bravo 1, Charlie 1, etc.) will get the 148 (Long Range) radio off of the SLs body as quickly as feasible. From there, you will regain communication with your PLT element ([later we’ll explore this in detail](battlefield-promotion-procedure.md)).

### A Tip on Battlefield Promotions

When an FTL ascends to SL, they can choose to continue leading their fireteam while leading the squad, or designate a new FTL from the current team.&#x20;

The benefit with designation is <mark style="color:orange;">it frees you up to focus on leading the squad,</mark> which can often be overwhelming on its own, let alone managing a fireteam at the same time. The drawback is that you might not have the team size to do it.

If your current fireteam is too small (less than three members including the FTL), it may be best to fold it into the other fireteam. This is especially true in large open environments, or in dense enemy contact. \
\
Doing so, you keep strength of numbers— <mark style="color:orange;">one larger, stronger force as opposed to an ineffective and weaker element</mark> that cannot amass fire and is easier overrun. Make sure you advise PLN of the change, as your squad's area of coverage will be slightly reduced.\
\
It is okay to take a moment to weigh decision making before committing to any squad planning or structure changes.\
