# Concise and Effective

***

### Concise Structure

Remember to <mark style="color:orange;">keep your communications and orders concise and specific to be effective.</mark>

> _“I’m seeing enemy moving up ahead...uh, probably like three hundred out.”_

That's better than nothing, but we can do better with some practice—

> _“ASL, A1, enemy fire team northwest, roughly three hundred out.”_&#x20;

Great! You've let your team know who’s talking, where the enemy is, and how far away they are. Adding additional information (moving left to right, bearing 330, etc.) is the sugar on top.

***

### Effective Communication

Be concrete and detailed, specific in where you want a team to go when giving an order.

> _"A1, we're heading West to the A1 Assault mark. From there, I want Red Team to take the tin shed and clear it so that green has a foothold to push through and clear after. From there we are clearing to our landing mark. Stick in buddy teams, soft clear. Once we're at the landing, hold facing West to keep our flank secure."_

Remember, though, that <mark style="color:orange;">just because you give an order doesn’t mean that it’s going happen, or happen fast.</mark> Many Arma players have an attention span/memory only a few minutes long, and will often forget what you’ve said as soon as the first bullet pops past their head.&#x20;

> _"A1, objective ahead. Red, clear the warehouse. Green, you're pushing after. Remember our landing marks, stick with your buddy."_

You may sound like a broken record by the end, but <mark style="color:orange;">never be afraid to repeat any orders given or recieved throughout the mission—</mark> it’s better to keep correcting than have a lone tank send your team to spectate.&#x20;

Good leaders say it once, <mark style="color:orange;">great leader's reiterate.</mark>&#x20;

### The Three D's

When calling out a contact, <mark style="color:orange;">remember</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark>_<mark style="color:orange;">**The Three D's**</mark>_:

1. <mark style="color:orange;">Direction</mark>
   1. Where should the team face to see it.&#x20;
      1. Specificity is brilliant, use compass bearings whenever possible.
      2. If you need it quick and rough (as we all do), use your DUI hud to give a cardinal direction.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">Distance</mark>
   1. How far away is the contact.
      1. Doesn't have to be meters, can be _close_, _medium_, or _far_.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">Description</mark>
   1. Is it a tank? BTR? Infantry?
      1. How many are there?
      2. Do they see us? Are they about to attack?

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:orange;">The amount of time you have to call contact is often dictated by distance.</mark> Shouting 'Contact north close!' might be all you can get out at first, but you can always add the rest later._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
A gunshot is also a form of letting your team know there's contact close— _<mark style="color:orange;">just be fast enough to get it off.</mark>_
{% endhint %}
