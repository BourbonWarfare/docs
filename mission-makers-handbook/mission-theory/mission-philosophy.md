# Mission Philosophy

* Less is more (ie. rockets on heli)
* Simple objectives can be enhanced with complex initial contact/side objectives
  * ie. defenses prior to the actual objectives&#x20;
  * an objective should be telegraphed
    * ie. if the objective is to find a box in a town, but the search area is a large area, the objective location should be built up and/or fortified so as to be easily recognizable by players. This gives the players catharsis.
* Missions can be better served following a traditional storytelling three-act structure [https://cdn-edgem.nitrocdn.com/YsQRZMAmbNVkBsDxLlxstsDCIgMiSrjR/assets/static/optimized/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/94e0d029219cadaed37d2ce000a18160.three-act-structure-livingwriter-1600x768.jpg](https://cdn-edgem.nitrocdn.com/YsQRZMAmbNVkBsDxLlxstsDCIgMiSrjR/assets/static/optimized/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/94e0d029219cadaed37d2ce000a18160.three-act-structure-livingwriter-1600x768.jpg)
* Deliberate action is welcomed by players(?)
* Players typically respond well to coordinated counter-attacks - stuck like a combined platoon as opposed to piece-meal fireteams.
