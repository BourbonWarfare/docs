# What POTATO Modifies

**Weapons:**

* CUP: M240, PKM, M249 Recoil modified - M249 nerfed while unsupported, PKM and M240 buffed while supported (better control)
* CUP: MP7 recoil adjusted to be usable (based on CUP MP5A5 recoil)
* CUP: Various CUP weapons now use better animations from other mods
* Smoke grenades/shells have much better fill and dispersion, and won't bounce as much when they land. This applies to smokes from mods as well as CDLCs (SOG). Smoke plume near or in the fringes of water have also been modified to actually create smoke. Smoke in deeper water will not create a plume.&#x20;
* New: Faux C7. Full-auto M16A1E1 and GL variant that is renamed to be "C7" and an M16A4 and GL variant that is renamed to "C7A2"
* PTV: All GL weapons from PTV can now take CUP weapons
* PTV: All PTV weapons have JSRS compat
* PTV: All PTV GL rifles have fixed ironsights for the GL
* GM: Allows GM weapons with rails to actually use CUP/PTV optics instead of using their own system

**Gear:**

* New: flashlight that has three light modes (Beam, normal, and flood) for both rifles and pistols. Beam that extends 150m but in a tiny cone, a normal light that extends like 65m in a larger cone, and a floodlight that extends 25m but in a huge cone.
* New: Adds a CBRN backpack but with an expanded inventory size. Still requires the Contact DLC to use.
* New: Adds White Phosphor (WP) versions of CUP NVGs that have IRL WP versions.
* New: Naloxone - Drug to remove any morphine in the patient's system. Not included in medic loadouts by default
* Contact: Increase storage capacity of Contact DLC Radio Backpack to hold ACRE radios and radio accessories. Should hold (1) large radio, (2) medium radios, and (1) ground-spike antenna/mast assembly.
* PTV: All PTV vests now have armor values in line with CUP armor values instead of being impenetrable
* RHS: Adds a large version of the RHS Medic Bag that is sized to fit our medic's standard amount of supplies.
* ACE Medical: Adds subtle audio SFX for various medical actions

**Vehicles:**

* Standalone MELB: Add Missile Guidance to MELB Hellfire
* Standalone MELB: Forced geo-lock on zoom levels 3 and above (previous no geo-lock)
