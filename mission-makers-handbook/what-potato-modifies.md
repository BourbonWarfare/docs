  POTATO, BW's custom mod, has many patches and changes to vanilla and modded
  gear to either fix it, make it more compatible with other mods, or bring it in
  line with other content.

# What POTATO Modifies

**Weapons:**

* Smoke grenades/shells have much better fill and dispersion, and won't bounce as much when they land. This applies to smokes from mods as well as CDLCs (SOG). Smoke plume near or in the fringes of water have also been modified to actually create smoke. Smoke in deeper water will not create a plume.&#x20;
* Explosives calculate distance from an explosive and apply death via overpressure when applicable (boom = more lethal)
* New: Faux C7. Full-auto M16A1E1 and GL variant that is renamed to be "C7" and an M16A4 and GL variant that is renamed to "C7A2"
* New: Candy Cane 9mm
* CUP: M240, PKM, M249 Recoil modified - M249 nerfed while unsupported, PKM and M240 buffed while supported (better control)
* CUP: MP7 recoil adjusted to be usable (based on CUP MP5A5 recoil)
* CUP: CUP ACR uses the PTV HK433 reload animation and the CUP old M4A1 uses the APEX DLC SPAR reload animation
* PTV: All GL weapons from PTV can now take CUP GL ammunition
* PTV: All PTV weapons have JSRS compat
* PTV: All PTV GL rifles with broken sights are now fixed
* GM: Allows GM weapons with rails to actually use CUP/PTV optics instead of using their own system

**Gear:**

* New: Plot Armor - webbing/gear that has max level armor for use in coops
* New: flashlight that has three light modes (Beam, normal, and flood) for both rifles and pistols. Beam that extends 150m but in a tiny cone, a normal light that extends like 65m in a larger cone, and a floodlight that extends 25m but in a huge cone.
* New: Adds a CBRN backpack but with an expanded inventory size. Still requires the Contact DLC to use.
* New: Adds White Phosphor (WP) versions of CUP NVGs that have IRL WP versions.
* New: Naloxone - Drug to remove any morphine in the patient's system. Not included in medic loadouts by default
* Contact: Increase storage capacity of Contact DLC Radio Backpack to hold ACRE radios and radio accessories. Should hold (1) large radio, (2) medium radios, and (1) ground-spike antenna/mast assembly.
* PTV: All PTV vests now have armor values in line with CUP armor values instead of RHS armor values
* RHS: Adds a large version of the RHS Medic Bag that is sized to fit our medic's standard amount of supplies.
* ACE Medical: Adds subtle audio SFX for various medical actions

**Vehicles:**

* All vehicles have a toolkit in their inventory
* VZ99 Man-Portable Mortar
* Standalone MELB: Add Missile Guidance to MELB Hellfire
* Standalone MELB: Forced geo-lock on zoom levels 3 and above (previous no geo-lock)
* CUP: Tank smoke plumes correctly
* ACE missile guidance patched for CUP&#x20;
* ACE viewports patched for CUP

**AI:**

* Technically an ammunition mod, but handheld rocket launchers and ground-vehicle mounted rocket launchers have had their "when to use" value adjusted so that AI will now more frequently use them against infantry and air vehicles. (ie. RPG-7V, MAAWS, SPG-9, etc.)
* Can be given Potatos and they will throw them at players/vehicles. Useful as Civilian/Protesters&#x20;
