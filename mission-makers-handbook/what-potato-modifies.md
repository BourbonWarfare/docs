# What POTATO Modifies

### **Weapons:**

* Smoke grenades/shells have much better fill and dispersion, and won't bounce as much when they land. This applies to smokes from mods as well as CDLCs (SOG). Smoke plume near or in the fringes of water have also been modified to actually create smoke. Smoke in deeper water will not create a plume.&#x20;
* Explosives calculate distance from an explosive and apply death via overpressure when applicable (boom = more lethal)
* Faux C7. Full-auto M16A1E1 and GL variant that is renamed to be "C7" and an M16A4 and GL variant that is renamed to "C7A2"
* Faux MG5. Uses the Marksman DLC's MG151 but rechambers it to 7.62x51 like the MG3.

* **PLA Armored Pack**:&#x20;

### **AI:**

* Technically an ammunition mod, but handheld rocket launchers and ground-vehicle mounted rocket launchers have had their "when to use" value adjusted so that AI will now more frequently use them against infantry and air vehicles. (ie. RPG-7V, MAAWS, SPG-9, etc.)
* Can be given the Potato grenade item and the AI will throw them at players/vehicles. Useful as Civilian/Protesters.
