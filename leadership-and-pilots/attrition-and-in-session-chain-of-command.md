# Attrition and In-Session Chain of Command

## Attrition

As operations continue, often there will be some amount of downtime to reorganize. At this time some elements may be under-strength to the point where they are no longer effective. These elements, whether a fireteam, squad, or platoon can be combined, often  referred to as being "folded into," another element in an attempt to maintain combat effectiveness. This may be done either by the request of the under-strength element, or by a higher echelon of leadership. The following are two examples:

* Bravo's two fireteams have taken heavy casualties leaving Bravo 1 with four members and Bravo 2 with two members. Bravo 2's fireteam leader may request to be combined into Bravo 1, with Bravo 2's remaining members coming under the command of Bravo 1.
* Charlie is attrited to six members after heavy contact. 1st Platoon lead requests that they join Bravo as a fireteam to help maintain some amount of cohesion.

An important note to remember when slotted in a leadership role:

While you may be reticent to put yourself under someone currently your equal, it often can be a better experience all around for both your element and the other to combine into a stronger whole.

## Chain of Command

Chain of command in BW is straight forward and favors leadership with knowledge and understanding of the initial plan and leadership intent shared by all squads at the beginning of the operation. In addition, there are two common methods to take a higher leadership position in BW. The first option that someone stepping up may take is to leave their element and join the higher one, electing another to take over leadership in their place. The second, and more error prone, approach is to maintain your current leadership position while also taking over for the role that needs filling. For example,

* A fireteam leader (FTL) taking over for a squad leader (SL) may elect to,
  1. leave their fireteam and elect another fireteam member to take the role of FTL while they act solely as the SL.
  2. lead the squad and their fireteam simultaneously&#x20;
* An SL taking over for a platoon lead may elect to either,
  1. leave their squad to an FTL and take over as platoon lead
  2. lead both their squad and the platoon simultaneously&#x20;

It is recommended to give up your previous leadership role and dedicate your attention solely to leading at the higher level for the best overall player experience. Use your best judgement about which approach is best for both those in your element and yourself.

### Company Level Chain of Command

* Company Lead
* Company Executive Officer
* Platoon Leads
  * 1<sup>st</sup> Platoon Lead (slotted)
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> Platoon Lead (slotted)
  * 3<sup>rd</sup> Platoon Lead (slotted)
* Platoon Sergeants
  * 1<sup>st</sup> Platoon Sergeant(slotted)
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> Platoon Sergeant(slotted)
  * 3<sup>rd</sup> Platoon Sergeant(slotted)
* Active Platoon Lead - Leadership of a platoon that died and is replaced by someone else (i.e., ASL for 1Plt)
  * 1<sup>st</sup> Platoon Lead (acting)
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> Platoon Lead (acting)
  * 3<sup>rd</sup> Platoon Lead (acting)

### Platoon Level Chain of Command

The below example is for 1<sup>st</sup> platoon, but can be adapted for others.

* Platoon Lead
* Platoon Sergeant
* Slotted SLs
  * ASL (slotted)
  * BSL (slotted)
  * CSL (slotted)
  * WSL (slotted)
* Acting SLs - Slotted Fireteam Leaders (FTL) or Senior Rifleman (SR)
  * Acting ASL (slotted A1 FTL/SR)
  * Acting BSL (slotted B1 FTL/SR)
  * Acting CSL (slotted C1 FTL/SR)
  * Acting ASL (slotted A2 FTL)
  * Acting BSL (slotted B2 FTL)
  * Acting CSL (slotted C2 FTL)
  * Acting ASL (did not slot FTL/SR)
  * Acting BSL (did not slot FTL/SR)
  * Acting CSL (did not slot FTL/SR)
* Slots with other important duties that require attention and should take over as a last resort
  * Medic
  * Forward Observers, Forward Air Controllers, or Joint Fire Observers&#x20;
  * Members of Weapons Teams (MAT, MMG, etc.)

### Squad Level Chain of Command

* Squad Lead
* Fireteam leaders (FTL), Senior Rifleman (SR), second in command (2IC)
  * 1 Fireteam Lead (slotted FTL/SR/2IC)
  * 2 Fireteam Lead (slotted FTL)
* Acting Fireteam Leads
  * 1 Fireteam Lead (did not slot FTL/SR, acting)
  * 2 Fireteam Lead (did not slot FTL/SR, acting)
* Squad Medic

### Fireteam or Lowest Organized Element Chain of Command <a href="#squad-level-chain-of-command" id="squad-level-chain-of-command"></a>

Leadership in the lowest level of organized structure in BW allows for flexibility in chain of command with no fixed hierarchy. It may be useful to discuss chain of command in safe start, especially in cases where fast succession of command is important (for example during a TvT). The only requirement is that the new leader "takes the mark" using the ACE self-interact menu and taking leadership of their element. In general, assistant automatic rifleman (AARs) and rifleman have the most flexibility to step up as acting leadership when there is no "next" in charge.

#### Standard Fireteam

One of the three lowest level structure BW uses is a six person fireteam consisting of:

* Fire team leader
* Automatic Rifleman (AR)
* Assistant Automatic Rifleman (AAR)
* Rifleman Anti-Tank (RAT)
* Rifleman 1
* Rifleman 2

When the FTL dies or is otherwise incapacitated, the AAR and two rifleman slots are in strong positions to step up as they're specialization is not pivotal to the fireteams power (more so the rifleman) where the role of leadership would require them to either split attention or risk themselves. In addition, an important weapon to the fireteams strength is the grenade launcher FTLs often carry. The fireteam should retain this asset in case of the FTL's demise. So in short, while anyone may step up, it is recommended that an AAR or rifleman does so.

#### MSV Squad

For an MSV squad consisting of:

* Squad Lead (SL)
* Vehicle Gunner (VG)
* Vehicle Driver (VD)
* Senior Rifleman (SR)
* Medic
* Automatic Rifleman (AR)
* Assistant Automatic Rifleman (AAR)
* Grenadier (AT, usually an RPG)
* Rifleman
* Marksman (often omitted)

MSV squads have two slots fixed in the chain of command, SL followed by the SR. Thereafter, there is no fixed chain of command, but the rifleman or AAR are again in a better place to take command with respect to availability and flexibility within the squad.

#### Commonwealth Section

A Commonwealth section (squad) consisting of:

* Commander
* Automatic Rifleman (AR 1)
* Assistant Automatic Rifleman (AAR 1)
* Rifleman
* Second in Command (2IC)
* Automatic Rifleman (AR 2)
* Assistant Automatic Rifleman (AAR 2)
* Rifleman

Finally the Commonwealth sections again feature two set chain of command slots, the commander followed by the 2IC. Again, the AARs and rifleman generally have the most flexibility to step up. Particularly the AARs when the rifleman are equipped with antitank weapons.

#### Final Thoughts

Finally, when squads become large enough (for instance seven members), color teams may see their immediate leadership assign leaders. They are softer roles, but are more experienced members ready to step up and take over if their immediate leadership is incapacitated.
