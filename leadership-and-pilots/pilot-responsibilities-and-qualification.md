# Pilot Responsibilities and Qualification

**Process for Qualification**

Any member can ask to be qualified as a BW pilot.

The actual qualification test focuses on TH, and should take anywhere between 15 and 40 minutes depending on the proficiency of the applicant. The Aircraft used is a CUP Mi-17 and the mission is stored on the BW Main Server.

Qualification tests can be completed by any qualified Pilot as a Proctor (ping the @Pilots role in Discord to get qualled).

The qualification test is a _**test**_, not a training course. You will be expected to complete the course with a Proctor with little guidance or tips outside of an explanation of the course. When in doubt, practice! Ask about how you can train on the same mission that will be used for the test.

## Pilot Responsibilities

**General Rules**

1. Only qualified pilots may fly during official BW sessions.
2. Crashes due to pilot error will require a requalification. Pilots who have crashed will be removed from the flight lists for both TH/AH until they are requalified.
3. Pilots have the final say on anything having to do with the safety of their helicopter. If at any point during the mission you have to override leadership to not lose the helicopter, that is entirely acceptable, it must be communicated to mission leadership.
4. You should have all communication equipment you will need to fly; if there are issues with radios/comms overall, communicate with admins/Zeus. Pilots are responsible for maintaining proper comms or assigning crew chiefs to manage it.
5. You should be monitoring your ammo count and helicopter health. You should also be aware of any resupply, repair, or refueling opportunity and how long you would be off station to conduct these actions.

**Slotting Screen**

1. Know which helicopter you would be flying if you slot and if you are completely comfortable landing the available airframe in stressful flight conditions. This includes different helicopter types, as well as which mod pack the helo is from.
2. Double check conditions, look for NVG tag and which map the mission is on.

**Map Screen/Planning Phase**

1. Fully read your briefing, and be aware of any pilot specific rules in the admin or personal tab.
2. Attend whichever command briefing is the highest level (COY or PLT) and listen quietly while command works on planning overall mission and potentially LZs. If there is a FAC work with FAC to plan LZs/Orbits and bring up any issues with the LZs they give you. If there is no FAC bring up any issues with LZs/Orbits during the command, but try not to completely interrupt infantry planning if you can avoid doing so.
3. If COY/PLT/FAC does not plan a flight path/orbit areas for pilots, you should work with any other pilots to plan both things. The flight plans should account for any terrain obstacles, or known enemy positions. The flight plan should include should include at least 1 alternate LZ for each main LZ.
4. If flying TH, know which infantry units you will be dropping at which LZs, also be aware of alternate LZs. If flying AH know what your initial orbit/pop up attack zones will be.
5. Double check that the helicopter you are using does not have any extra weapons/issues not mentioned in the briefing/admin/personal tab.

**Initial Flight to Mission AO**

1. Wait for COY/PLT/FAC/Flight Lead to call for spool, and afterwards liftoff. If TH, you should attempt to ensure all troops you are responsible for flying on the initial flight are in.
2. If you are flying TH and the initial LZ is too hot or unsuitable for landing under current flight conditions, you should deviate to the alternate LZ immediately. If the alternate LZ is also unsuitable for landing, you should immediately begin coordinating with mission leadership for a place to land, or fire support to clear out an LZ.
3. If rapid troop deployment is critical to mission success, any suitable landing area nearby the planned LZ is acceptable to land.
4. TH should attempt to ensure all troops dismount at the LZ. If people are not dismounted within a reasonable amount of time, that is on them and the pilot should liftoff.
5. AH should be protecting the LZs until all troops are dismounted unless mission leadership or initial flight plan states otherwise.

\
**Post-insertion AO flight.**

1. If TH
   1. After dropping off troops TH should move into pre planned orbits. If there is a pre existing orbit marked out, TH should follow the orbit plan unless it is too dangerous to do so.
   2. If there are no pre planned orbits, THs should coordinate with each other and potentially FAC to establish a safe orbit. All THs should attempt to orbit in the same direction unless being called in for specific duties.
   3. If THs are called for CAS, they should attempt to orbit the called target to maximize gunner time on target vs doing gun runs unless the call is for a rocket strike.
   4. THs should also be scouting for heavy concentration of enemy infantry, or any enemy vehicles/emplacements while orbiting.
   5. THs should be coordinating with mission leadership on when or if troops need to be moved to different LZs, and should follow the initial flight rules on LZs.
2. If AH
   1. After initial drop off of troops AH should move from protecting LZs to pre planned orbit or pop up positions. AHs should coordinate with any other pilots to ensure they are aware of other orbits.
   2. AHs should coordinate with mission leadership for any direct close air support callouts.
   3. AH should follow planning phases rules of engagement if not given direct CAS orders.
   4. AHs should also be scouting for heavy concentrations of enemy infantry, or any enemy vehicles/emplacements while in flight.

**Mission wrap-up phase**

1. If there are no more direct orders for pilots, pilots should continue to follow all responsibilities of post-insertion flight until mission end.
2. If an extract is ordered, pilots should coordinate extraction with mission leadership and other pilots.
3. If there is no extract order and communication from mission leadership has ceased, the objectives are not complete, and infantry has taken heavy casualties, pilots should coordinate with surviving infantry to extract. If no contact with infantry can be established, all pilots should RTB.
