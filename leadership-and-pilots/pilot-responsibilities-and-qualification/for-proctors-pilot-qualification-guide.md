## Failure Conditions

#### _Overall_

The helicopter may NOT sustain damage during it's landings, with the following exceptions:

* INST (Instruments): <mark style="color:orange;">Orange</mark>
* SLG (Slingload): <mark style="color:red;">Red</mark>

#### _Live-Fire Considerations_

When in the live-fire zone, the Applicant's helicopter may sustain _as much_ _damage_ as possible as long as the Applicant can still manage to complete their orbits and landings.

***

## Administrative Info

The Proctor will be in the co-pilot seat of the Applicant's helicopter for the duration of the test.

At any point in time, the Applicant may land the helicopter in a safe area and repair it or ask the Proctor to repair it (via an ACE-interact option).

The Proctor also has access to the ability to damage/destroy certain features of the Applicant's helicopter. This can be done via ACE-interacting and selecting either the "Destroy Engine" or "Destroy Tailrotor" options - it's self-explanatory what does what.

So long as the Proctor is satisfied that a crash was unavoidable, or that the Applicant did everything within their reasonable ability to prevent the crash, the Proctor may waive crashes.

{% hint style="info" %}
FOR ENGINE MALFUNCTIONS

Examples of reasonable conditions include, but are not limited to when the Applicant is:

<pre><code><strong>Hovering at or above 200m in height above solid terrain.
</strong>Flying at high-speed at or above 150m in height above solid terrain.
Conducting maneuvers at or above 300m in height above solid terrain.
</code></pre>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
FOR ANTI-TORQUE MALFUNCTIONS

Examples of reasonable conditions include, but are not limited to when the Applicant is:

<pre><code><strong>Hovering at or above 150m in height.
</strong>Flying at high-speed at or above 150m in height.
Conducting maneuvers at or above 150m in height.
On approach to land at a landing zone of their choice.
</code></pre>
{% endhint %}

If an Applicant is unable to successfully qualify or re-qualify after three tries within a week, the Applicant will enter a "cooling-off" period where they cannot re-qualify for _at least_ a week after their most recent try. It is expected for the Applicant to use this "cooling-off" period to practice their flying before they attempt to re-qualify.

***

## Proctoring the Course

> Keep in mind that the Applicant might one day be the pilot who is flying _you_ around the battlefield - proctor with that in the back of your mind.

### Radio Familiarity

***

Verify with the Applicant that they know and understand how to manipulate at least two (2) radios with relative ease. If they do not display firm confidence, consider going into the Teamspeak and conducting a radio check there in order to affirm that the Applicant has the ability to manipulate both radios.

### Flight Planning

***

In addition to being a good practice as we'll discuss below, this will also serve as a nice segue to show the Applicant what the qualification course will actually entail - things like the tunnel, the landing zones, the live-fire zone, etc.

As mentioned above, this section can be of great importance when proctoring - a pilot who is unable to read terrain can easily mistake a hill as a "perfect" ingress route, endangering the airframe and its occupants as well as delaying the platoon's landing plan. Being able to identify good, safe, and quick paths to and from an LZ should come naturally to a pilot.

As such, as the Proctor, you should ask the Applicant to _at the very least_ talk through their flight plan for the qualification, discussing ingress routes, potential landing zones, and egress routes. If you feel as though it is more productive, have the Applicant actually draw out their flight plan to give you a visual representation of what they'll be trying to do during the qualification.

### 3-Part Intro

***

After having discussed the flight plan, you should then direct the Applicant to:

1. Fly to Section 1 as marked on the map and enter into a _clockwise_ orbit. The Applicant should be able to maintain a steady flight speed and altitude without deviating too far from the circle for _at least_ two (2) full rotations.
2. Then, fly to Section 2 as marked on the map and conduct a landing anywhere within the prescribed box. They must stay stable at their chosen landing zone for _at least_ 10 seconds before lifting again.
3. Then, have the Applicant to fly _north_ of Section 3 as marked on the map. Direct the Applicant to enter the "tunnel" by flying a north-to-south route with _at least_ 150km/h speed when entering the "tunnel". The Applicant should then land inside of the prescribed box within a reasonable amount of time, staying stable at their chosen landing zone for _at least_ 10 seconds before lifting again. The Applicant should then exit the "tunnel" via the eastern exit.

This section is intended for the Applicant to showcase the _**core competencies**_ expected of pilots flying in BW.

### Landing Zones

***

There are six (6) landing zones marker by purple boxes in this section. The Applicant is required to fly to and land at every one of these six landing zones before moving on to the next section.

While there are no hard failure conditions for this section outside of the general ones, it is recommended that the Proctor keep a mental count for how long it takes for the Applicant to land at each of the landing zones - and in the event that an Applicant cannot land at a zone within a reasonable amount of time, that they ask the Applicant to either re-approach the landing zone, or fail them depending on circumstances.

{% hint style="info" %}
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME

It is in my opinion that if an Applicant takes longer than 45 seconds upon flaring and entering the landing zone box, or spends a significant amount of time hovering and/or "hunting" for their landing zone, that the Applicant should be asked to re-approach or be failed depending on the circumstances.
{% endhint %}

A tip or trick for Proctoring this section is for the Applicant to have already marked where they would want to land within the zone so as to give the Proctor a reference point to judge the Applicant by. Note that it is fine if the Applicant has to deviate from the LZ - after all, no LZ is perfect and the map can be deceptive.

### Live-Fire Zones

***

Note the <mark style="color:red;">red circle</mark> to the south containing the towns of Sainte-Marie, Chapoi, and Cancon. This is the **first** "Live-Fire" zone. Within this zone there are two purple boxes marked - these are the landing zones that the Applicant must land at.

In this zone, the Applicant can expect to face active enemy infantry as well as mobile APC threats.

The Proctor will direct the Applicant to enter into an orbit following the prescribed circle. It is at the Applicant's discretion at what height and what speed they wish to hold the orbit at. The Applicant is expected to complete _at least_ one full rotation before heading towards a landing zone each time.

Like in the previous sections, the Applicant must stay stable at their chosen landing zone for _at least_ 10 seconds before lifting again and _reentering_ their orbit as described above.

The **second** "Live-Fire" zone is marked by another <mark style="color:red;">red circle</mark>, but this time with a <mark style="color:red;">red exclamation point</mark> at the center of it.&#x20;

This zone is the MANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense System) section, where the Applicant will be expected to showcase their ability to defeat a missile threat using evasive maneuvers and countermeasures.

For this test, have the Applicant fly _at least_ 200m in height with _at least_ 175km/h in speed. The recommended upper limit is 400m in height and 250km/h in speed.

Direct the applicant to enter into an orbit following the prescribed circle using the aforementioned conditions. Direct them to continue the orbit until the MANPADS fires - at which point, they are free to maneuver as they see fit to save the airframe from harm.

If the AI MANPADS gunner does not fire after a reasonable amount of time, feel free to remote-control the gunner via Zeus to fire at the Applicant.

{% hint style="info" %}
MULLIGAN RULE

If the Applicant is unable to defeat the missile for whatever reason on the first try, it is at the Proctor's discretion to allow a one-time "mulligan" in which the Applicant is allowed to re-try the MANPADS section.
{% endhint %}

### Airframe Malfunctions

After all Landing Zones and Orbit Patterns have been completed, the Proctor should fully repair the helicopter and then have the Applicant fly at their leisure around the map. When it is reasonably appropriate to do so, the Proctor should ACE-interact and destroy either the helicopter's engine or the helicopter's anti-torque rotor _**without**_ prior warning. This must be done in an area where the Applicant can reasonably succeed in an emergency landing.

So long as the Proctor is satisfied that a crash was unavoidable, or that the Applicant did everything within their reasonable ability to prevent the crash, the Proctor may waive crashes. With that said, the Applicant should be able to make _at least_ one successful landing per malfunction before the Proctor concludes the test.
