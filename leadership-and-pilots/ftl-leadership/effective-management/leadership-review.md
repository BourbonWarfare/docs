# Leadership Review

<mark style="color:orange;">Any member can establish a leadership thread</mark> in the #leadership-discussion channel on discord. You will have to create one when you take the SL qualification, but it's highly encouraged to start one as soon as you begin your FTL journey.&#x20;

The purpose of the leadership thread is to <mark style="color:orange;">reflect on your experience at session and find ways that you can grow as a leader.</mark> To do this, think back through the things that went well and went poorly, and reflect on ways that you can carry your wins forward while improving on your mistakes.

{% hint style="info" %}
_This doesn't have to be a multiple paragraph page response, <mark style="color:orange;">only a way to help you improve and solicit advice from your peers.</mark> Bullet points work well if you're in a rush, though you get out what you put in._
{% endhint %}

These leadership threads are not private, and are publicly available to other members. Courteous and respectful conversation is encouraged, and when someone makes suggestions, it's because they want you to grow and develop as a leader. In turn, it's always best to be[ constructive and polite ](../../../intel/wip-further-reading/critiquing-other-members.md)when you're drafting your feedback for others.

_If you're not getting much feedback, you can ping your fireteam members or those in direct proximity to your leadership whose advice you'd appreciate._
