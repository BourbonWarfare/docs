# Don't Show Frustration

### The Fastest Way to Harsh the Vibe

Think about how many times you’ve had a leader start talking to you about how the project your team has been handed is useless and a waste of time, or that now you’re screwed because a timeline has shifted and they can’t control it. <mark style="color:orange;">Does it make you want to work on that project?</mark>&#x20;

_**No.**_&#x20;

You’ve seen that you’re working on something hopeless, or that the leadership above you doesn’t have your back and you’re wasting your time. <mark style="color:orange;">That exact principal applies here:</mark> think of every mission as a micro project planned out in 15 minutes and executed over an hour. If you start complaining about how pointless your task is, <mark style="color:orange;">is that going to make your team want to keep playing?</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">Frustration is something you will feel,</mark> and it’s something you’re going to have to work with, but letting your team see or hear your frustration in the heat of the moment is the greatest way to kill your team’s morale and drastically affect everyone’s enjoyment of the session.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_We as leaders are not advocating for you to bottle it up or sit on it, only <mark style="color:orange;">to channel your frustration in a way that helps you and the team.</mark>_&#x20;

### Shit Sucks, Lets Work Through It

In _Saving Private Ryan_, CPT. Miller talks to his team about how “the bitching only goes up.” Why? His team isn’t in <mark style="color:orange;">any position to solve the strategic problems he’s been handed,</mark> and to saddle them with that is to take away from their responsibility acting as an extension of his plan.&#x20;

Any griping about what’s going on should be saved for your fellow leadership elements, the ones who have control over the mission, and kept away from those who don’t really have a say in it.

And, of course, <mark style="color:orange;">we have to burn off that frustration after.</mark> There’s no better way than to vent to a friend in voice, draft up feedback <mark style="color:orange;">to post later,</mark> or grouse about it while you’re chilling with your significant other (if you’re so lucky, but you’re reading this, so we both know the answer to that).&#x20;

There’s a reason that those frustrations have been built up, and that’s because problems arose during session that got into our animal brains and <mark style="color:orange;">need to be fixed.</mark>&#x20;

That’s the core of it, though: they need to be fixed. We’re going to be playing with these same members in the future and so <mark style="color:orange;">if we just blame them and leave it at that, we’re dooming ourselves to more frustration.</mark> The key is to find polite and constructive ways to identify the problem that occurred and collaborate to fix it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_We want our feedback to be heard, so we need to be kind and polite, but we can’t let that stop us from delivering the negative feedback._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:orange;">Think of it as helping the other person.</mark> We were all at a point in our lives where we didn’t know how to do something, but the only way we got better was by having a kind word from a friend point out what went wrong. That way we could identify the problem, fix it, and have a better time next time. <mark style="color:orange;">That’s what we as leaders are trying to facilitate.</mark>
