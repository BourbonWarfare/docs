# Coordinating with Other Leaders

### Coordinating the Squad Plan

The terrain features, cover and concealment options, and intent of <mark style="color:orange;">a mission will usually require  additions and slight deviations from the mission commander's plan, and proper squad coordination is required</mark> to maintain cohesion during ever changing plans<mark style="color:orange;">.</mark> Fireteam leaders may need to communicate with each other to accomplish the SL's plan, and may need to use initiative to adjust orders before the mission begins.

These inter-team adjustments will occur for the entire mission, and might change the plan that your SL has set in place, good SLs will take your suggestions into account during planning phases. Remember, a plan is set before you reached contact, and you will likely be the first leader to the enemy and can adjust as needed later on. If the plan seems bad or full of holes, offer alternative ideas, but still be ready to follow orders.&#x20;

### Flex and Maneuver

One of the great things about FTL leadership is <mark style="color:orange;">it allows you a lot of flexibility to take initiative.</mark> If you have a good SL, they will allow you the room to take charge of your team and carry out the plan they’ve mapped out. Doing so enables you to directly coordinate with the other FTL in your squad to maneuver your elements and set up fires.

If you are making a move, <mark style="color:orange;">coordinate who is going where</mark> while you’re on said move. Communicate if your team has better sightlines or approach paths than your sister team and adjust the plan accordingly. Use your radios to stay updated on other leaders, and update them back as you move.

Battles are one first and foremost by [positioning](../terrain-positioning-battlespace/positioning.md); you cannot get effective fire on a target if you’re in the wrong spot. There’s almost always opportunity to move fluidly with the other team, and <mark style="color:orange;">your ability to coordinate on your short range is as important a weapon as your rifle.</mark>&#x20;

Additionally, you also don’t have the entire picture of the battlefield; your Squad Leader is worrying about the bigger view of your situation. If your SL tells you to hold position or not to maneuver, do not immediately ascribe this to bad leadership, and do not use initiative as an excuse to override them. <mark style="color:orange;">You might be acting outside of your leadership’s intent, or you might be pushing into danger.</mark>
