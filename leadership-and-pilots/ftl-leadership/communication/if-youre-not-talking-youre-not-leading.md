# If You're Not Talking, You're Not Leading

### Establishing Command Presence

An axiom of leadership training is that <mark style="color:orange;">you should be able to tell who the leader is just by entering the room—</mark> the leader is the one everyone is looking to, the one who is talking, the one giving out orders.

This doesn’t mean barking commands or talking just to talk. You don’t want to be rude to your fellow members, and <mark style="color:orange;">you don’t want to constantly talk without giving meaningful information.</mark> People will tune you out, and your team will not work effectively.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_You **always** want it to be clear that your team is getting their information and orders from you or your SL._
{% endhint %}

### So, My Team is Moving Without Me...

Your SL might call movement over the net and your team begins moving without your call— that’s fine. Repeat the order to demonstrate that <mark style="color:orange;">you are active and that you’re carrying out the order</mark>, then think of what you’re going to do when you get to the next position:

* <mark style="color:orange;">How</mark> are you going to carry out your task?
  * <mark style="color:orange;">What</mark> movement will your team take?
  * <mark style="color:orange;">When</mark> are you moving?
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Where</mark> will they end up?
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Why</mark> are they doing it?

Quickly come up with answers, and communicate that to your team. <mark style="color:orange;">Make sure you issue a clear, concise order, even if just repeating SL.</mark> Anything is better than nothing, and it gets everyone focused forward on the next task.

> _"A1, ASL, step off West, we're heading to Waypoint 2."_
>
> > _**"A1, stepping off West."**_
>
> ...
>
> > **"A1, we're following the defilade to the South. Green left, Red right. I want our focus to the South-West to protect our flank."**

What you want is to make sure your team isn’t only getting orders from the SL. Yes you’re all on the same net, but <mark style="color:orange;">you still have direct command of your team, and should order them as needed.</mark>&#x20;

Find ways to think ahead, and then relay them. <mark style="color:orange;">If you always know your next steps, you will always be in a position to give guidance and lead.</mark>

_You can find ways to delineate where your team goes by colour team, ensure that they’re keeping their spacing, dictate which cardinal directions they’re responsible for watching, what formation you’re taking, etc._
