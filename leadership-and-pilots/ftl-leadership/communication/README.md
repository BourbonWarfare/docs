### The Importance of Giving Good Information

> _All warfare is based on communication - Sun Apo_

As an FTL, one of the most crucial aspects of your role <mark style="color:orange;">is providing information to your SL.</mark> Remember, _**information flows up and you are the primary source of infantry information.**_&#x20;

No one will see that tank before you or your fireteam members, no one will see that enemy squad before you do, no one will see that bunker before you. <mark style="color:orange;">And if you don’t report it, someone in the PLT will suffer.</mark>

It can be daunting to hop on the squad net, but no one will judge you. Yes there are often quite a few people speaking already, but don’t let that put you off— <mark style="color:orange;">you are in charge, and you get to speak. You may even need to cutoff SL.</mark>
