# Radio Procedure

***

### Your Most Important Weapon

Radios are mission critical to the FTL, you should be using them to keep in contact with all squad members and issue orders to colour teams.&#x20;

In BW, <mark style="color:orange;">we don’t have any hard and fast radio procedure—</mark> it is not mandatory to say ‘over’ at the end of a transmission, start questions with an ‘interrogative,’ or any number of the unique phrases you’ve heard from military related content.

That being said, <mark style="color:orange;">the following procedures are helpful to utilize.</mark> Ending a transmission with an ‘over’ allows the conversing element to know they can transmit a response, or calling ‘break’ as you transition from one transmission to your next also keeps traffic flowing.  ‘Break, break’ may be called to interrupt a longer transmission with an immediate important communication. <mark style="color:orange;">General basic procedures are never frowned upon,</mark> and may benefit your communication.

### The One Rule

The key requirement is to <mark style="color:orange;">address the recipient of your message first, and then identify yourself. This is doubly critical on PLN.</mark> If you were Alpha 1 and calling the Alpha Lead, an example of what you would say is:

> &#x20;_“Alpha Lead, Alpha 1, \_\_\_\_.”_&#x20;

What you’ll often hear in session is the abbreviation:&#x20;

> _“ASL, A1, \_\_\_\_.”_&#x20;

Both of these mean the same thing, one is just quicker to say.&#x20;

### Keep in Mind—

<mark style="color:orange;">Brevity is key.</mark> It’s okay to have longer transmissions, but you want to be as efficient and as quick as possible when keying your mic in order to ensure that other elements aren’t waiting for you to stop speaking so they can transmit.&#x20;

_In heavy contact, a <mark style="color:orange;">considerable amount of information has to flow quickly,</mark> and ensuring that you get critical information out with minimal extra language is key to making sure other elements can do the same._

_There are some rare missions FTLs or SQLs may not have radios. These missions will be clearly tagged with "reduced radios"._
