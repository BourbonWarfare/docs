# Composition of Company Elements

## Composition of Company Elements

Within game, the Chain of Command is as follows:&#x20;

> _Company (COY) -> Platoon (PLT) -> Squad Lead (SQL) -> <mark style="color:orange;">FTL</mark>_

Depending on player count, there will be between one and four squads assigned beneath a platoon element, and <mark style="color:orange;">two to three fireteam elements slotted beneath each squad leader.</mark> Each fireteam element will have up to eight members, though <mark style="color:orange;">oftentimes you will work in reduced sizes.</mark>&#x20;

&#x20;A reduced size element typically consists of the Automatic Rifle (<mark style="color:orange;">AR</mark>), the Assistant Automatic Rifle (<mark style="color:orange;">AAR</mark>), and Rifleman Anti-Tank (<mark style="color:orange;">RAT</mark>). Additional members will take rifleman slots.

_In rare circumstances, additional roles can be assigned per Mission-Maker (MM) intentâ€” this is beyond the scope of this document. During joint operations with other groups, multiple platoons may be utilized._&#x20;
