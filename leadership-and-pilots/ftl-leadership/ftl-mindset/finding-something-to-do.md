# Finding Something to Do

### Let's Take Initiative

<mark style="color:orange;">There is always a task that needs to be done even if your SL hasn’t given you one,</mark> and it’s a perfect time to take the initiative. Your primary goal as an FTL is to support your SLs intent for an overall goal or task, and you should be looking for ways that you can achieve that without being told.

&#x20;A great FTL is the one that seeks out advantageous positions, anticipates the next order, and makes the SL’s job easier by being proactive. Two skilled FTLs can run the SL’s plan, flex and adapt it, and execute the overall goal with minimal management from the SL.

### Practical Examples

* _<mark style="color:orange;">**You should start by setting up a security perimeter.**</mark>_
  * Any time you’re you’re halted, pick a direction and set your team up to watch it.&#x20;
  * Communicate to the other fireteam which direction you’re facing so that they can watch a different one.
    * Keeping security prevents enemy elements from walking up on you unawares.
    * Try not to clump up with other squads or your other fireteam.
* _<mark style="color:orange;">**Proactively ensure your fireteam members are spaced.**</mark>_
  * Spacing means that no two teams are able to be killed by the same explosive.
    * &#x20;ideally no two players can either.
  * Call over the radio, assign people to different trenches, or even call out formations.
    * It's okay to sound like a broken record; better repetitive than dead.
* _<mark style="color:orange;">**Take the quiet to plan and think ahead.**</mark>_
  * If you’re in a lull in combat or sitting in the back of the vehicle, find your next position on the map and plan out how you’re going to get there.
    * Take the time to brief your team on how you’re going to accomplish your movement.
* _<mark style="color:orange;">**Give and receive preemptive reports.**</mark>_
  * Sitting in a quiet spot is a perfect chance to check your team’s ammunition/health and call up.
  * Plan out where a good spot for a resupply might be, or when you'll begin running out of ammo.

This isn't an exhaustive list, but a few measures you can take to keep your FTL Mindset engaged and working through the next few objectives. If you're always thinking ahead, you'll always be in a position to lead.&#x20;
