# FTL Mindset

***

Taking the FTL position is <mark style="color:orange;">a step up from playing in a regular slot:</mark> you will have greater responsibility and a larger voice in how the mission plays out. It’s expected that you will take this role seriously, and that you will <mark style="color:orange;">seek to improve your leadership and communication abilities as you play.</mark>&#x20;

That is not to say that this is a high-pressure role, quite the opposite. The FTL position is <mark style="color:orange;">designed as an intro to leadership,</mark> that’s why there’s no qualification— to follow the old cliche, it is easy to learn yet difficult to master.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">We want you to have fun in this role</mark> while accepting a greater responsibility within the leadership structure. There will still be time to joke around, but your primary goal is to lead your team to success, and to do that you need to know when to <mark style="color:orange;">switch into a serious mindset.</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Joking around comes after you’ve taken care of your tasking, and it always stops as soon as you get a radio call or need to step off and take care of a new goal._

### Setting Up for Success

<mark style="color:orange;">You set the tone of the night, now.</mark> [Your attitude](../effective-management/dont-show-frustration.md), [how you carry yourself](finding-something-to-do.md), and [how you interact](../effective-management/dont-blame-subordinates.md) with your other members will determine the mood of a session.&#x20;

Think back to how many times you’ve had a leader dead-focused on the mission and how confident you felt that your team would be driven to succeed in their objectives.&#x20;

Now think back to a time where your leadership was goofing around and ambling to objectives. How did that night go? Was your team able to complete the plan effectively?

You want to be the first kind of leader, the kind who can get a task done <mark style="color:orange;">and has people who want to slot under your command.</mark> That might sound daunting, but it's actually quite simple. You always want to be thinking of the mission goal, and your next series of steps to accomplish it. If you're always thinking of a plan for how you're going to accomplish the next task, <mark style="color:orange;">you'll always be in the right mindset.</mark>&#x20;

_We're not joking about cutting the comedy as soon as you get a radio call. The number one cause of missing a crucial command is shooting the shit. <mark style="color:orange;">As soon as you hear your SL or a contact call, drop the conversation.</mark>_
