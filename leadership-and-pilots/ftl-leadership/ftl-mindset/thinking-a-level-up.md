# Thinking A Level Up

### Using Your Big Brain

FTLs often need to think like SLs, as SLs often need to think like PLTs.&#x20;

By thinking like your SL, you understand why you are being placed in certain positions or are carrying out orders in a specific way. <mark style="color:orange;">You're seeing the bigger picture of your smaller picture movements.</mark> This allows you _accurately_ modify the steps of your plan in order to accomplish that big picture view. Otherwise, your actions might adversely affect the greater plan in motion.

For example, if you're placed in a Support By Fire Position in a road crossing a saddle, <mark style="color:orange;">you should be thinking of what the strategic significance of that position is.</mark> If you're thinking like your SL (who is in turn thinking like PLT), you understand that you are protecting the flank of your forces from enemy armor and infantry.

<mark style="color:orange;">Knowing this, you understand the limits of your initiative:</mark> you can flex your position only as far as you're still able to support your friendly elements, and it would be more tactically valuable to be at the hilltop adjacent to the saddle. You know that addressing threats and relaying threat information is critical, and also that you cannot aggressively pursue the enemy at risk of leaving your platoon open to assault.

_If you are able to asses a fireteam situation as a squad leader would, <mark style="color:orange;">it will allow you to better interpret the intent behind an order and make better initiative driven adjustments</mark> to the plan._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You should also be aware of the position, strength, and ammunition count of any other fireteams in your squad. This knowledge is in case you need to assist them rapidly, and in case you end up in charge of them due to other leaders becoming incapacitated. You do not need to ask for this information over SQN if you don't know it immediately, <mark style="color:orange;">but should listen in on more than just your Fireteam's comms and orders.</mark>
