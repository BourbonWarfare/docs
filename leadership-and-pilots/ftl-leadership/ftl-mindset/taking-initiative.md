# Taking Initiative

When you were playing as a regular slot, you were expected to take your orders and execute them. Thatâ€™s still a component here, but <mark style="color:orange;">with the increased responsibility of running a fireteam you also get the authority to decide how to accomplish those orders.</mark> You have much less flexibility than your SL, but when given an order you are freely allowed to slightly adjust the plan, as long as you follow the intent of the person giving the order.

<mark style="color:orange;">To demonstrate initiative is to find ways to carry out your SL's orders as effectively as possible without having to be instructed to.</mark> If you see an opportunity to better your squad or team's position, you have the ability to make a judgement call to take that opportunity. It is possible that unplanned maneuvers may be required to follow the commander's intent.

Some common examples of demonstrating initiative:

* Reading the terrain around you and adjusting your position to exploit [key terrain](../terrain-positioning-battlespace/using-terrain.md).
  * Radioing up information you've gained from your new position.
  * [Setting up your teams](briefing-as-an-ftl.md) to focus on areas of enemy ingress.
* Noticing you have a poor avenue of approach and shifting to a favorable ingress.
* Switching sectors with your sister FTL in a town clearing operation.
  * Adjusting Support By Fire (<mark style="color:orange;">SBF</mark>)/ Base of Fire (<mark style="color:orange;">BOF</mark>) positions due to sightlines.
* Witnessing Enemy Infantry overrunning your sister FTL and [shifting to support.](../terrain-positioning-battlespace/positioning.md)

_<mark style="color:orange;">Always relay on SQN any ideas which may result in your team moving from a planned position/or path</mark> to achieve a better outcome. If you don't receive a response from your SL, and do not have present orders to hold, you typically may direct fireteam as needed._
