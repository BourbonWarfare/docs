## Milliradians

Milliradians, also known as _mils_ or _mrads_, are angular units of measurement—similar to degrees in a circle.

A milliradian's size is derived from the SI (metric system) unit of a _radian_, or _rad_.\
The prefix _milli-_ is an SI standard term (based on Latin) to denote multiplication of the parent unit by one thousandth (10^-3), or division by one thousand.\
Thus, **one milliradian is one-thousandth of a radian.**\
Conversely, one radian is equal to one thousand milliradians.

So, then... what is a radian?

The full definition of a radian can be found in _The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition, 2019_, as follows:

> The radian is the coherent unit for plane angle. One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius.\
> It is also the unit for phase angle. For periodic phenomena, the phase angle increases by 2π rad in one period.

This definition may be confusing at first. Let's decompose the relevant parts:

* The _coherent unit_ criterion basically means that the radian is **not** defined by any extraneous conversion factors, such as the geometrically arbitrary 360° (three hundred and sixty degrees) in a circle. We will see why, exactly, later in the definition.
* A _plane angle_ is a fancy way of saying a two-dimensional angle, delimited by two rays (one-dimensional lines extending infinitely in one direction), or _sides_, extending from one point, the _vertex_.
* One radian is defined as the angle (plane angle) which is _subtended_ (delimited, having its full extent defined, the sides of the angle intersecting a line segment), with the center of a circle (any circle, no matter the size) as the angle's vertex, by an _arc_ (a curved line segment, in this case a circular arc with the same curve as the circle—in other words, a section of the circle's circumference), where the length of that arc is the same as the circle's _radius_ (the linear, straight-line, shortest distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle's edge).
* Basically, **the angular size of one radian is the same for any circle, because the radian arc length is equal to the radius.**
