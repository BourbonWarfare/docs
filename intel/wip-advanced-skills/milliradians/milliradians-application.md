### Mental Hacks

The milliradian range equation can be thought of in terms of the ratio of the object's full size to the angular size of the object in milliradians.

$$
Range=\frac{Dimension}{Angle~(mrad)}*1000
$$

From this, it can be seen that the range to target scales _linearly_ with changes in the angular size, or range to, the object.\
When the angular size of the object is the same as its actual size, the range will be equal to $$1,000$$ units of distance.\
Increasing the angular size decreases the range, or vice versa.\
Increasing the range decreases the angular size, or vice versa.

Using this fact can greatly speed up calculations, allowing you to determine the range or size of objects, or the necessary angle for a certain distance at range, without the need of any calculating tools.
