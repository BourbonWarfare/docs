# Infantryman's Kit

As a basic rifleman in a fireteam, you are provided with the following per standard loadout:

* **A standard infantry rifle with a total of ten (10) spare magazines.** This is your main fighting rifle and what you'll be using for the majority of the mission, circumstances withstanding.
* **Two (2) hand grenades.** These are useful for clearing structures and buildings, as well as flushing enemies out of cover and into your fireteam's line of fire.
* **Two (2) smoke grenades.** These are used on enemies to break their line of sight, provide temporary concealment for yourself or your teammates to maneuver, or to disengage and retreat from enemy forces.
* **Medical supplies, which include four (4) elastic bandages, two (2) packing bandages, one (1) splint and one (1) tourniquet.** These are used for yourself and your battle buddy in case one of you gets hurt. Patch yourself up in relative safety and protected by friendlies, as you are vulnerable while doing so.
* **One (1) AN-PRC 343 short-range radio.** This is used for intra-squad communications. You will mostly hear callouts from your squad lead and fireteam leads here, alongside any orders your squad leader might issue you. The maximum effective range of the radio is 300m. **Do not drop this.**
* **One (1) set of map tools and flashlights.** These are to be used for land navigation, especially when you are far away from your fireteam and squad. The flashlight is used to provide illumination for your map at night time, though it produces a visible glow on your character. Only use the flashlight once you ensure you are safe.
* **Two (2) cable ties and two (2) IR strobes.** The cable ties are used for capturing POWs, civilians and POIs. The IR strobes are used for friendly identification with NVGs and other assets with thermals and night vision.
* **A map, a compass and a watch.** For land navigation. Standard for all roles.

In addition to what is standard for a standard rifleman, core roles in the fireteam also have the following in their kit:

* **For automatic riflemen:**
  * **An automatic rifle/ LMG with around 400-600 rounds of ammunition.** Your role is to provide suppression for your fireteam and to fix enemies from moving from their position.
  * **A pistol**, for self-defense sake when you need to reload your main weapon.
* **For assistant automatic riflemen:**
  * **Extra ammunition for your AR.** You are to feed ammunition to your AR as needed, and to link their belts if necessary.
  * **A set of binoculars.** For use in spotting, directing fire for your AR, and communicating adjustments accordingly.
* **For anti-tank riflemen:**
  * **One (1) light anti-tank weapon.** Your role is to disable enemy vehicles appropriate to your anti-tank capabilities. For a light anti-tank (LAT) role, this usually means most Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) and some Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV).
* **For fireteam leaders:**
  * **An underbarrel grenade launcher on your primary rifle.** Your role is to provide indirect fire support to the squad, alongside marking targets and suppressing enemies with smoke. You also (should) have the following grenades for your UGL:
    * **Five (5) High Explosive (HE) or High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) grenades;**
    * **Two (2) white smoke grenades;**
    * **Two (2) red smoke grenades;**
    * **Four (4) yellow flare grenades (only for night mission use).**
  * **A GPS and a Micro-DAGR.** This is used to navigate you and your fireteam according to your SL's plan, and to quickly identify what is up ahead.
  * In addition to the grenades you have as a rifleman, you also receive some **extra coloured smoke grenades** for use in marking and signaling to other elements. These include:
    * **Four (4) extra white smoke grenades;**
    * **Two (2) green smoke grenades;**
    * **One (1) purple smoke grenade;**
    * **Two (2) chemlights (only for night mission use).** These can be attached to your person, or dropped to mark locations.
  * **A pair of binoculars**, for spotting targets for your fireteam.
