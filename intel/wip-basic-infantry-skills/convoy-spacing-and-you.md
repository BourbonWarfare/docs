# Convoy Spacing And You

We've had practically back to back collisions in recent memory that have wiped out squads. This is unacceptable. Seriously. In future I may suggest everyone is respawned save for the drivers if it encourages better spacing. We can't be respawning a squad + special elements every single coop.\

It's not hard. If you want to go advanced, treat every squad as their own march unit. If we're all in one truck, easy. If we're in humvees or other small vehicles, a bit more complicated but should be easy enough. March units stay together, and maintain good spacing but are close enough to cover each other (if armed.) **Spacing should be 20-50m depending on speed. Higher speed = larger spacing.**\
\
A serial can be, for our purposes, treated as a platoon's worth of vehicles. It could be smaller, depending on the situation. I don't care about the specifics. Serials should have larger spacing between them than march units. This is to avoid elements of 2 platoon getting mixed in with 1 platoon units. Serial spacing can be pushed to 100 or more meters depending on the scenario. This also units behind the lead formation to react to contact before they are themselves caught in the ambush. A march column would be the entire force.\
\
So if our order of march was 1st platoon - Coy - 2nd platoon, we'd have:\
\
A serial made up of all of first platoon's march units.\
A march unit comprising COY and any attached units (Engineers, SAM, etc)\
A serial made up of all of first platoon's march units.\
\
This can further be broken down. 1st platoon's serial would have an order of march of A - B - Cmd - C.\

\* I marked BSL twice. I'm not going to fix it, you get the idea.\
\
At the end of the day, I don't give a single shit about any of the specifics. Or the terminology. **Just. Stop. Crashing.** If this helps some people get a better idea of spacing and helps avoid these incidents - Great!
