# \[WIP] Basic Infantry Skills

Welcome to the infantryman's guide to surviving a BW session.

The purpose of this guide is to introduce you to how we conduct warfare, and what you need to know before the bullets start flying.\
While our tactics, techniques, and procedures sometimes match—or greatly draw from—their real-world counterparts, it would be silly to teach you real-world tactics for a virtual game environment.&#x20;

With that in mind—take this guide seriously; you may be expected to know these skills.
