# Responsibilities

### Preparation Phase

This is the time in which leadership makes a plan and issues a briefing.\
"Safe Start" is usually active during this time, to mitigate damage from any accidents.

{% hint style="info" %}
If planning is done on the map-screen—known as "Brief-on-Map"—you should remain quiet until the mission launches, to allow your leadership to plan.
{% endhint %}

1. Mentally read your briefing (in the menu on the left of the map-screen) to understand the overall task & purpose of your mission.
2. Make sure all your gear is good-to-go. Check uniforms, medical supplies, weapons, ammo, and any special equipment. If you have any issues of gear missing or working improperly, notify your team leader and contact an admin to have your gear reset.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x49;n some missions, you can change the optic on your weapon by `ACE Self-Interact >> Equipment >> Optics`. Optics can only be changed while Safe Start is active._
3. Don't disturb any briefings you haven't been asked to attend. It's okay to hang out and chat while leaders plan, just do that far enough away that you won't disturb them.
4. Attend your unit's briefing. Stay near your team leader. Make sure your buddy is with you.
5. Offer suggestions or feedback when prompted/urgent, but don't hijack leadership authority.

### Staging Phase

Staging occurs after briefing, but before the unit begins movement.&#x20;

1. Know your team's task & purpose, in case your leader becomes incapacitated.
2. Know the distance and direction of planned movements. Know your team's formation, and the overall formation & responsibilities of the other elements around you.
3. Mount/embark vehicles fast when ordered. Follow proper convoy spacing if you are driving.
4. If in a crewed vehicle, do not disrupt the crew's communications on the intercom, especially during situations like takeoff/landing or enemy contact.\
   Some chatter during calm transit is acceptable.

### Mission Execution Phase

1. Follow orders from your leader, even if they make decisions you don't think are the best.
2. Utilize standard battle drill/tactics as best you can, while coordinating with your team.
3. Keep track of your buddy team's ammo, medical status, and equipment.\
   Update your leader on any significant changes.
4. Do not use enemy gear or vehicles without direct orders.
5. Use clear & concise radio protocol while in combat.\
   During calm moments, unless you are told otherwise, some radio chatter is acceptable.
