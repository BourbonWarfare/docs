# Russian Vehicle Identification

Been hearing a good number of players call out BTRs as BMDs, and other things. So I just threw a picture guide together. Not the best pics, so if someone else wants to provide better ones, cool.

## BTR Family

Primary infantry carrier of the Russian Federation and their allies. Easily distinguished from MT-LBs and BMPs by its use of wheels instead of tracks. Are amphibious in game. Depending on variant, can sit 8-12 soldiers inside, and in game others can ride on top (WiP). All vehicles except the BTR80A are counted as APCS, equiped with a 14.5 HMG and a 7.62 MMG.

### BTR 60

Shorter than the other BTRs, with no gaps between any of the tires.\

### BTR 70

Elongated hull, with side hatches between the two front and two back tires.\

### BTR 80

Updated 70 model. Moves the searchlight to the turret, freeing up LoS.\

### BTR 80A

Part of the modernization program of Russian forces, the 80A adds a new, taller turret system to the vehicle, housing a 30MM cannon and a 7.62mm MMG. The Russian Defense Ministry count is as a IFV, not a APC. Turret also has better optics.\

## BMP Family

Each Russian mechanized force includes at least one tank battalion. Because BTRs cannot keep up cross country with the tanks, the infantry that support these tanks are equipped with BMPs instead, using tracks for better mobility, and better armament for large scale mechanized warfare. The BMP-1 was the first true IFV ever introduced, and sent the NATO member countries into panic. All but the uparmored versions of the BMP are amphibious in real life, but not in ArmA. The BMPs were the first vehicles designed to stay with and fight with the infantry. As such, they have a very low profile, about the height of a man (Excluding the missile mount) making it very easy to conceal these vehicles.

### BMP 1

Early models of the BMP 1 can be identified by an exposed missile on the top of the turret. Later versions have a more sophisticated missile mount. BMP 1s are equipped with a 73mm low pressure smoothbore cannon and a 7.62mm MMG for infantry support. This main armament while useful in Afghanistan, was quickly outclassed by NATO developments in armor.\

### BMP 2

To answer the requirement for a better armed vehicle, the BMP 2 was produced, mounting the latest ATGM mounts and a 30mm automatic cannon loaded with armor piercing and high explosive belts.\

### BMP 3

And then Russia went crazy. They reduced the infantry carrying capacity, added some better armor, and put this monster of a turret on it. Replacing the traditional top mounted missile with a 100MM cannon, capable of firing various types of ammunition, including the 9M117 Bastion gun-launched ATGM, the same 30MM cannon as the BMP 2, and a 7.62MM machine gun. Some variants add in grenade launchers as well. There are also two hull positions for infantry to shoot machine guns from. The BMP 3 remains one of the best armed IFVs in the world.

The WIP Model

## BMD Family

The Russian Federation maintains the only Airborne Mechanized force on the planet. The VDV can fight as paratroopers, or as air deployed light mechanized forces depending on the situation. The BMD is essentially a miniature BMP, able to be carried in tactical transport aircraft.
