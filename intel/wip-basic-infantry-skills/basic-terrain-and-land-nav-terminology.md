# Basic Terrain and Land Nav Terminology

Here is a basic list and example of terrain features and what they look like to aid in land nav and communication.\
\
There are 5 major terrain features you will encounter in land nav.

## **Hill, Ridge, Saddle, Valley** and **Depression**

As well as 3 "minor" or derivative features, which exist with and augment the major features.

## **Draw, Spur**, **Cliff**

A basic idea of how these terrain features look and function can be visualized by making a fist and open hand.

## **Hill**

pretty self explanatory. It is a raised terrain feature that has elevation descending it on all sides

## **Ridge**

an area that stretches laterally, functionally composed of a series of **Hills** joining together, with the in-between areas still remaining higher than the surrounding area.

## **Saddle**

alternatively, "pass", is the lowered area between two **Hills** which links the two. A **Saddle** generally exists as part of a **Ridge** but it can be used to indicate other much shallower areas between two points of interest.

## **Valley**&#x20;

the opposite of a ridge. A long lateral area which has a reasonably flat "floor" that winds and runs between **Hills** and **Ridges**. Valleys are a common place for roads and other such features that require level ground.

## **Depression**

similar to a valley, but it has the distinction of being isolated, and not running any long distance, entirely ringed by higher elevations also commonly referred to as a "bowl."\
\
Minor features exist in conjunction with major features.

## **Draw**

is a small narrow recess that usually runs the length of a hill, and is depressed beneath the general slope of the terrain feature it derives from. It is usually very narrow, and runs to the "floor" of the valley.

## **Spur**

the opposite of a **Draw** and consists of a raised area that runs away from the peak of a hill or ridgeline. They are generally much broader, and the sides are characterized as being quite steep. Useful for defilade, **Spurs** can provide hard cover, and defilade for rearward manuver\
\
I shouldnt need to define and illustrate a **Cliff**. If you're on one, you'll figure it out pretty quickly.\
\
A lot of this is common sense when you're looking right at the terrain features, but being able to ID them on a map or during planning can greatly aid your team's safe movement through terrain of all types.
