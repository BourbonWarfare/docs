## Using Your microDAGR

### Plotting and navigating a route with DAGR way points

1. Plot your route on the map with normal map markers in the appropriate channel
2. Open your DAGR interface by hitting **Home** twice and pull up the map screen using Button 3
3. On the map screen double click on the location of your first WP.
4. On this new screen enter a unique name for your WP, I suggest 'WP1', and click okay.
5. Click the button **SetWP** to set this first WP as your currently active one.
6. Use Button 3 to pull up the map and repeat from step 3 for each WP you wish to place, skipping step 5 for all but your first waypoint.
7. Use Button 1 or Button 2 to view your active WP and navigate, depending on your preference.
8. As you arrive at each of your waypoints open your DAGR and pull up the waypoint management view via Button 4 > Button 8
9. Select your next waypoint from the list and click **SetWP** to set it as your new active WP.
10. Delete WPs you no longer need to prevent confusion going forward.

### Providing accurate contact reports/Air strikes/Fire missions using a Vector 21 and microDAGR

1. Open your DAGR and pull up the options view by clicking Button 4.
2. Click on Button 10 to connect your Vector 21 and DAGR. Your view will change to the main view with an blank active WP, and you will see a red laser icon in the top left of the view if they have connected properly.
3. Close or shrink your DAGR with the **Ctrl+Home** or **Home** keys.
4. Bring your Vector 21 up to your eyes, observe your target and briefly hold **TAB+R** to pull both Azimuth and range on your target. The DAGR will not accept any information unless you provide both simultaneously.
5. Your active WP information displayed on the main and compass views is now accurate to the position you lased.
6. This WP will not show up on your list of WPs and if you select another WP to be active you will need to re-laze the target.
